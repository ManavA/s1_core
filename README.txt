Simply RISC S1 Core
===================

This is the README file for the S1 Core (codename "Sirocco");
all the informations you need are contained in the text files
that you can find in the "docs" subdirectory:

  - README.txt        Summary (this file)
  - INSTALL.txt       Quick Installation Guide
  - REQUIREMENTS.txt  System Requirements
  - SIMULATION.txt    Simulation Environment
  - SYNTHESIS.txt     Synthesis Environment
  - SPEC.txt          Functional Specification
  - SUPPORT.txt       Support and References
  - LICENSE.txt       License for Design and Documentation
  - TODO.txt          To Do List

Probably now you just have to read the docs/INSTALL.txt file.

Please note that from OpenCores http://www.opencores.org or the
Simply RISC website at http://www.srisc.com you can always
download a single PDF specification that is just a collection of
the text files included in the CVS tree and listed above.

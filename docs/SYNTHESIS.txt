Simply RISC S1 Core - Synthesis Environment
===========================================

The scripts to run synthesis are similar to the ones
used for simulations, you can still use the free Icarus
Verilog software (that will target an FPGA application)
or a commercial Design Compiler tool from Synopsys (that
will be used for ASIC).

With Icarus you will use the "fpga" target, to do so
just run:

  build_fpga

If you want to use Synopsys Design Compiler instead you
have to use:

  build_dc

Please note that the commercial tools are NOT supported, and
they will probably not work unless you fix all the required
parameters properly (we are focusing on free software since
we want to build up a community of developers around the S1).

The results for these two kinds of scripts are in the
directories:

  run/synth/fpga/

and

  run/synth/dc/
